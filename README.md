This is a bookstore website. The basic idea of building this website is to help people more focusing on the book quality via looking through book information and reviews. We dedicatedly designed this website with three different users, guest, login user, and admin user. Each of them have different authorities.  

> As a guest:
	>> browser all existing books
	>> search for a specific book
	* read detailed book information
	* read book reviews from others
As a registered user:
	* inherit guest user
	* update personal profile. 
	* Write review
As a admin: 
	* inherit registered user
	* manage all registered users, including update user's profile, delete user, and assign users admin authority.
	* mange all books, including adding book, update book's information, and delete book.
